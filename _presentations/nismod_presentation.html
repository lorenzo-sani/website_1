## Introduction

* Given the limited time we can only give you a flavour of version control

* This session will provide a bit of theory and a bit of practical demonstration

* A more detailed practical will be scheduled for next term

* Version control (and git in particular) has a steep learning curve â€“ do ask
  for help getting started

* There are many resources for self learning
  * Software Carpentry
  * Courses within the University of Oxford
  * The Research Support team in SOGE

## Motivation!

---

## Motivations

- Ability to move back, try things out, 'unlimited undo'
- Log of changes to code
- Working together, not accidentally overwriting
- There is only one 'latest' version
- Remote backup (in the cloud)

Opportunities

- Publishing code in citeable form
- Open-source integration with testing, code quality, documentation

---

## Concepts

- **repository**

  a place for a project

- **commit**

  a small set of changes, which accumulate to make a **history** of commits

- **remote** repository

  a place to share a project (Gitlab, Github)

- **branch**

  a way to separate work on new versions, bug-fixes or features
